### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Techboy! I'm a bit old for 'boy', but it works.

Pronouns: He/Him

Platforms: Windows/Linux
- Prefered Windows version : Windows 8.1 Pro (yes)
- Prefered Linux distro : Lubuntu 21.04 atm (lxqt is bae)

Coding experience:
- Batch (Windows, basic scripting)
- Bash (Linux/Ubuntu, basic scripting, invoking programs with env variables [DRI_PRIME=1])

What does Techboy do?
- He lurks on GitHub
- Spends too much time on his many computers
- Spends too much money on yet another computer/iDevice/whatever

âš¡ Fun facts:
- I'm an autistic dude with ADHD. Explosive combo.
- I carry a Pixel phone and a iPod Touch. Yes. Cross-platform, indeed.
- Angered at almost *everything*. But you won't *really* know it, unless you are in a call with me. Or i write angry.
